# Bingoserver
This is the repository for the backend of the [Trackmania Bingo](https://github.com/Geekid812/TrackmaniaBingo) plugin. It is written in Python using [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/#). Map selection uses the [Trackmania Exchange API](https://api2.mania.exchange/).

## Deprecation notice
This implementation will be replaced in favour of [Geekid812/Bingohost](https://github.com/Geekid812/Bingohost) in plugin version 3.0. This repository is currently in maintenance mode and will be archived once this server is fully replaced.
